# Appion Inc. (odoosh-v11-production)

 
## Branches :
- SH Production Branch  : **_production_**
- SH Staging  (you can only have three staging branches):
   - 1st Staging Branch :  **staging-1**
   - 2nd Staging Branch :  **_production-copy_**
   - 3rd Staging Branch :  **TBD**
- Development (you can have as many development branches as you like): 
   - 1st Development Branch : **11.0-runbot**
   
## Code of Conduct
- **IMPORTANT : DO NOT COMMIT anything in the _production_ branch, because _production_ is _Production Instance_**
- If you want to start development branch fork new branch from _production_ or _staging_ branches and SH will automatically start a new development build.
